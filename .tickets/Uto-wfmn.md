# Province News parser - define requirements

The requirements doc currently says 'Will be added later' for Province News. This ticket covers writing the detailed spec for the Province News parser before any implementation begins.

Province News is distinct from Province Logs - it shows the news feed for a single province (incoming and outgoing events as seen from that province's perspective), whereas Province Logs is the internal action log.

Deliverable: Expand the 'Overview of Province News Requirements' section in 'Utopia Game Parser Requirements.md' with:
- Input format details
- Supported event types and their text patterns
- Output format and section structure
- Any special calculation rules
