# Parser outputs: include reference to UtopiaFormatter.com

Update each parser output label/title string to include a reference to the website `utopiaformatter.com`.

Examples:
- Kingdom News Report from UtopiaFormatter.com
- Province News Report from UtopiaFormatter.com

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every parser output that emits a user-visible report name/label/title includes "from UtopiaFormatter.com".
- Existing output formatting remains unchanged aside from the appended website reference.
